## Trading terminal
trading-terminal(TT) full access ;)


Hope all’s good on your end.
Wanted to share something off-the-radar that I’m only offering to a few trusted exchanges I personally know.

Long story short — I’ve got internal access to the full TradingView Trading Terminal widget.
That’s the exact same widget we license to big exchanges at $30,000/year.

👉 I can get it to you for $5,000/year – 85% off – no middlemen, no red tape. Just clean access.



Why? I’ve got direct access to the codebase and I’m keeping this low-key — so it’s strictly between us.

## ✅ What you get:
Full-featured TradingView Terminal widget

Professional charting experience (multi-chart layout, Pine Script, indicators, overlays, and more)

Direct trading from the chart

Seamless integration with your exchange via API

White-labeled with your branding

Basically, the same user experience Binance, Bybit, or Kraken users are getting — for a fraction of the cost.

## 🔗 See it for yourself:
Here’s a live demo so you can play with it:

My TT version: "TT v29.2.0 (internal id 92e59637d61b6a77468d0026d24a07296d63e896 @ 2025-04-07T16:52:52.125Z)"
👉 [Demo Link](https://trading-terminal.tradingview-widget.com/)

I’ll be honest — this isn’t some lightweight iframe. It’s a high-performance terminal that’ll instantly level up your UI/UX and boost user engagement + retention.

## Why now?
🔒 Private deal, only sharing with a couple hand-picked exchanges

⏳ This library updated every month after you paid for 12 month

👀 Completely off the books – just between us

Let me know if you want access for a test run — I can spin it up for you quickly.
Once you're happy, we’ll finalize and I’ll hand over everything you need to integrate.

Let’s talk if you're even 10% curious. This deal won’t be around for long.
